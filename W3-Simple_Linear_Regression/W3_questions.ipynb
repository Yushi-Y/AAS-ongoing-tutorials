I would also recommend spending some time to understand hypothesis testing because this is probably more useful to your research than confidence intervals. You will almost certainly need to use a hypothesis test in your summative. I'm not sure you could really do much statistics without using a hypothesis test. I haven't got any questions on hypothesis testing here but take some time to read about it in a textbook or watch one of the videos. There are also some questions on Adam's problem set."

This starts from a really basic level. I would also recommend looking at [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL-NNb4gojA&list=PLwJRxp3blEvZyQBTTOMFRP_TDaSdly3gU&index=13), which is about the logic of linear regression and minimising the sum of squared errors. It's a bit more maths heavy but the theory is important.\n",

Also an explanation of when to use the t-distribution: [Hypothesis testing with the t-distribution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46SqMrzQQ2w).
