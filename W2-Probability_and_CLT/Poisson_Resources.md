Below are a couple of useful resources for understanding the Poisson distribution.

[Physics and Maths Tutor Cheat Sheet:](https://pmt.physicsandmathstutor.com/download/Maths/A-level/Further/Statistics/AQA/Cheat-Sheets/Poisson%20Distribution%20I.pdf)
This is a nice overview of the basics of the Poisson distribution. What it is and how to use it.

[Textbook chapter:](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/webtemplate/ask-assets/external/maths-resources/images/Poisson_dist.pdf)
A bit more detail about the Poisson distribution. How it links to the Binomial distribution and the intuition for the mean and variance results.

[Expectation Proof:](https://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Expectation_of_Poisson_Distribution) For those of you that want to look into the proof of the expectation.
Also see the [variance proof](https://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Variance_of_Poisson_Distribution) which is not too much of a jump once you've understood the expectation proof.
These proofs are above the level expected of this course but people with maths and stats experience should be able to do them.
